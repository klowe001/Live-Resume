## Executive Summary

BCG Principal and Gen AI Node Lead with 8+ years driving growth strategy for Fortune 500 brands across retail, beauty, travel, hospitality, and airlines. I lead GTM like a product builder: define the economic goal, instrument the learning loop, ship in slices, and coach teams while staying close to the work.

What makes me different: I build. Top 1% Replit user in 2025. Founded an LLC and shipped multiple full-stack AI-native applications. I translate strategic vision into working products using modern development tools and agentic AI workflows.

**Core identity**: A strategist who actually builds. The best insights come from shipping.

---

## How I Think

### Strategy Through Execution

The most elegant strategy is worthless without the ability to ship. I've spent years translating business intent into engineering specs, financial models, and operating rhythms that actually move organizations. Now I build products myself to close the loop entirely.

- Strategy without execution is theater
- The gap between "recommendation" and "shipped outcome" is where value is created or destroyed
- I've sat on both sides: the consultant who frames the decision and the builder who makes it real

### AI as Amplifier

AI accelerates judgment. I use agentic workflows to prototype in hours what once took weeks, but the value still comes from knowing which problems to solve and how to shape solutions that people actually want.

- AI is a force multiplier for people who already know what to build
- The bottleneck has shifted from "can we build it?" to "should we build it?"
- I use Claude Code, Replit Agent, and other tools not as novelties but as core workflow
- The companies that win will have leaders who understand both the strategic context and the technical implementation

### Economics-First GTM

Unit economics, pricing mechanics, loyalty systems—I've worked at the intersection of customer experience and P&L impact for Fortune 500 companies. Every product decision should connect to a measurable outcome.

- Loyalty programs are financial instruments with marketing attached
- Pricing is the most underleveraged strategic lever most companies have
- I model revenue lift, redemption liability, and unit economics before recommending action
- GTM is how the product meets reality

### Player-Coach Mentality

I go hands-on where it reduces iteration cycles or unblocks others. Build the first version, document the pattern, then coach someone to own v2 and v3. Success means the team can ship without me.

- The best leaders know when to step in and when to step back
- "Player-coach" means deciding what to do yourself vs. delegate based on where you create the most leverage
- I measure success by whether the team can ship without me
- Teaching is scaling. When I transfer a capability, I've multiplied my impact.

## Education

### The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania
**Master of Business Administration** | 2020 – 2022  
Strategic Management & Entrepreneurship

- Director's List (top 10%)
- First-Year Honors (top 20%)
- GMAT: 740

**Reflection**: A transformative window into ~1,000 classmates' industries, beliefs, and worldviews. Built a network spanning finance, tech, consulting, and entrepreneurship. Sharpened thinking on strategy, operations, and building organizations that scale.

What I took away: The world is far more varied than any single career path reveals. Exposure to classmates from private equity, tech startups, nonprofits, government, and family businesses gave me a more complete mental model of how value is created and captured across contexts.

---

### Southern Methodist University
**Bachelor of Science, Mechanical Engineering** | 2011 – 2015  
Minor: Business

- Magna Cum Laude
- Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society
- Honor Roll
- Micro-fluidics Research Assistant
- GPA: 3.86

**Reflection**: Engineering taught me to think in systems and constraints. How to break complex problems into components, model behavior, and iterate toward solutions. These fundamentals still shape how I approach product and strategy.

The engineering mindset: Define the problem precisely. Identify constraints. Model the system. Test hypotheses. Iterate. This is as true for building a loyalty program as it is for designing a heat exchanger.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm exploring roles where strategy and building converge:

1. **AI Product Leadership**: Roles where I can shape product direction while staying hands-on with the build. Actual shipped products, not strategy decks.

2. **Growth & GTM at High-Velocity Companies**: Companies where the economics matter, the iteration speed is fast, and the team expects leaders to get into the work.

3. **Founding Something New**: The longer-term possibility. My technical capabilities and network continue to develop. The right problem and the right co-founder could accelerate this.

**What I bring**:
- Strategic depth from 8 years at BCG across Fortune 500 clients
- Hands-on building capability demonstrated through shipped products
- AI-native workflow that accelerates everything I do
- Economics-first thinking that connects product decisions to business outcomes
- Player-coach mentality that builds teams and transfers capability

**What I'm optimizing for**:
- Proximity to the build
- Rate of learning and skill development
- Working on problems that matter
- Team quality and culture fit
